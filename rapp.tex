\section{Result}
\subsection{PN junction UI}
The following graph was plotted for the PN junction U-I characteristics. See the measured data in the appendix together with the matlab-code.

\subsection{PN junction capacitance}
The following graph was plotted using the measured data in the appendix for the capacitance in the PN junction. See appendix for values and matlab-code.

\end{figure}

\subsection{NPN transistor}
The following graphs were plotted for the current in the npn transistor. The early voltage was calculated to 34V using matlab. See the appendix for values and matlab-code.

\section{Analysis of the result}
\subsection{NPN transistor}
As you can see to the left in figure \ref{npn} an increasing voltage from zero to about 0.25 volts results in a substantially increase in the collector current. The current does'nt increase to infinity and beyond though. The steep increase stops since there is no more electrons that can diffuse from the emittor through the base to the collector.

To calculate the early voltage a linear function was aproximated to the eleven largest values that were measured. To find the aproximation function $p(U) = ax + b$ polyfit was used in matlab (see appendix). Using the function and calculating $p(U) = 0 => x = \frac{b}{a}$ the earlyvoltage was found to be $\frac{139,9}{4,1} \approx 34V$.
