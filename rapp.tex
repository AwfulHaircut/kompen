\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this lab is to gain a better understanding of the bipolar transistor characteristics. By altering the different potentials over the three sections of the transistor we hope to establish a connection between them and in that way learn to understand it. The lab mainly consists in three parts, measuring the capacitor in a pn-junction, measuring the current through a pn-junction and measuring the currents through a bipolar npn-transistor.

In the first part we are studying the capacitor in the pn-junction. The total capacitance that is found in a pn-junction actually consists of capacitors from two different origins, one is called junction capacity and the other one is called diffusion capacity. The junction capacity exist because of that the depletion area has a very high resistance so that when the n and p sections has voltage difference the junction can be seen as a capacitor. The second capacitor origins in the neutral part of the p-doped section. When the pn-junction is forward biased the the

\section{Analysis of the result}
\subsection{PN junction UI}
In figure \ref{pn_ui} the current to voltage ratio is plotted from the measured values. Since this is a PN junction it is expected to behave like a normal diode. In the graph it is clear that the current through the pn junction is zero until it the voltage over the junction reches about 0.7V. This value of the forward voltage is expected and is about the same for all pn junctions.

The forward voltage exists since...

\subsection{NPN transistor}
As you can see to the left in figure \ref{npn} an increasing voltage from zero to about 0.25 volts results in a substantially increase in the collector current. The current does'nt increase to infinity and beyond though. The current that flows through the transistor is dependent on the current that the powersource can deliver. The steep increase in current stops since there are no more electrons that can diffuse from the emittor through the base to the collector in the transistor.

To calculate the early voltage a linear function was aproximated to the eleven largest values that were measured. To find the aproximation function $p(U) = ax + b$ polyfit was used in matlab (see appendix). Using the function and calculating $p(U) = 0 => x = \frac{b}{a}$ the earlyvoltage was found to be $\frac{139,9}{4,1} \approx 34V$.

The right graph in figure \ref{npn} shows the current that flows from the base to the emittor. Since this is a pn-junction it was expected that the current to voltage graph would look like a diodes graph, which it does. The forward voltage for the pn-junction is shown in the graph to be about 0.6-0.7 V which is normal vlue expected for a diode.
